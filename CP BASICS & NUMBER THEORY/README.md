# ğŸš€ CP Basics & Number Theory

This folder contains key concepts, tricks, and implementations essential for building a strong foundation in **Competitive Programming** (CP), with a special focus on **Number Theory**.

These techniques help solve problems efficiently under tight time constraints, commonly found in coding contests and technical interviews.
