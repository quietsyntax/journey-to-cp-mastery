# 🔃 Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of various **sorting algorithms** – a foundational concept in computer science and programming interviews.

Sorting is used to arrange data in a particular order (ascending/descending) and is often a crucial preprocessing step in many algorithms.
