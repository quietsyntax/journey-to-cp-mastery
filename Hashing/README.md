# 🔐 Hashing Algorithms & Techniques

This folder contains problems and implementations based on **Hashing** — a fundamental concept in data structures used for fast data access, searching, and frequency analysis.

Hashing enables average-case **O(1) time complexity** for insertion, deletion, and search operations, making it ideal for solving problems efficiently.
